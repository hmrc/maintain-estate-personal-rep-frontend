# Maintain estate personal rep frontend

This service is responsible for updating the information held about a personal representative in an estate registration.

To run locally using the micro-service provided by the service manager:

***sm --start ESTATES_ALL -r***

If you want to run your local copy, then stop the frontend ran by the service manager and run your local code by using the following (port number is 8829 but is defaulted to that in build.sbt).

`sbt run`
